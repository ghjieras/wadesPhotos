## 🎨 Customization

### Adding Your Photos

1. Navigate to `src/assets/images/section-XX/` (where XX is 01-04)
2. Replace the image files with your photos
3. Update `src/assets/images/imageConfig.js` with your image filenames

```javascript
const imageConfig = {
  'section-01': {
    main: 'your-main-photo.jpg',
    gallery: ['gallery-01.jpg', 'gallery-02.jpg', 'gallery-03.jpg']
  },
  // ... more sections
}
```

### Updating Text Content

Edit `src/assets/content/contentConfig.js` to update:
- Section titles and subtitles

```javascript
const contentConfig = {
  'section-01': {
    title: 'Your Project Title',
    subtitle: 'Your subtitle',

    details: {
      title: 'Project Name',
